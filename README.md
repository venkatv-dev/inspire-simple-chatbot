# Inspire Simple Chatbot

A minimal, single-file HTML chatbot you can open in any modern browser. It’s designed to be easy to read, copy, and extend—perfect for learning, demos, or adding a lightweight chat UI to a static site

## Features

- Single `chatbot.html` file (no build step, no dependencies)
- Basic chat UI: message list, input box, send button
- Simple, readable JavaScript for handling user messages
- Easily customizable styles with plain CSS

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chatbot.html` in your browser.
3. Type a message and hit Enter (or click Send).

That’s it.

## How It Works

- The page renders a simple chat container with a scrollable message list.
- User input is captured from a text field.
- Messages are appended to the chat log with basic role styling (you vs. bot).
- The “bot” response is currently a placeholder and can be replaced with any logic you want (e.g., rules, FAQs, or an API call).

## Customization

- Edit text, styles, and behavior directly in `chatbot.html`.
- Replace the response logic function to:
  - Echo or transform user text
  - Implement keyword/intent matching
  - Call a backend or model API (ensure you do this securely—see Security below)

## Folder Structure

- `chatbot.html` — The entire app (HTML, CSS, and JS in one file)

## Roadmap (Optional)

- Persist chat history (localStorage)
- Markdown rendering for messages
- Connect to a lightweight backend for real responses
- Add accessibility improvements (ARIA roles, focus management)
